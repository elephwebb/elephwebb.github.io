Done using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted at [GitHub](https://pages.github.com/).

Based on theme designed by expert [Michael Rose](https://mademistakes.com/), special thanks!. 
Check the [original code source repository](https://github.com/mmistakes/jekyll-theme-basically-basic).

Check his other Jekyll template: **[Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes)**, added cool stuffs like javascript posts search and a better organization system to medium and large websites, content-driven like FAQS, Documentation Portals, it worth take a look. 

And for those that like Jekyll and automated tools and perfomance just read this great article wrote by him on **[Jekyll Optimization and Working Flow](https://mademistakes.com/articles/using-jekyll-2017/**)

Happy code! Keep learning.
