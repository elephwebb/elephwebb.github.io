The goal of this project was to create a Wordpress plugin using PHP that connects to three Marketplace APIs: MercadoLibre, ZonaProp-Navent and OLX. 

Big part of the job was to read every documentation and model the way our APIPublishingWrapper had to me created so we could get the same properties fields generated by another WP Real Estate Plugin was generating and them have in the format required by each API. Otherwise the APIs would not accept our POST/PUT **payload**. Sweet :-)

For every API we had to authenticate first, the great and positive aspect of the integration is that some of the APIs like ML has an extensive and well documented API, which give us even a Validator Out-of-box so we can make a Request to this Validator which will check our request data and see if is correctly and follows their API Schema. That was fantastic, and of course, we had to implement it so our APIPublishingWrapper could access this validator in case the Portal Network was ML.

This was part of the job, read, understand how each API Schema Works and the way they were built. Then second we had to build our clean and concise UI/UX parsing data from the API, enabling OAuth2 Authentication, Token Refresh and also getting data and comparing with our DB.

### Setting all the API Keys and Secrets in one place ###

As also the redirect OAUTH callbacks and also the automatically response system that some APIs like the one that MercadoLibre provides which allows us to catch automatically the questions made by our clients in the products we are selling, in this particularly case, real estate.

### Generate a XML to be exported ###

Generate a XML file automatically from the data inside the database in the format that OLX could read and enabled it always through a WP REST API endpoint

Check here the output of the OLX [WP REST Endpoint](https://www.globocenter.com.br/workana-qa/wp-json/isobrokers/api/v2/feed/olx) enabled.
