This was a quite complex project due to the many mobile native components that were required to be used together and at once, but thankfully, IONIC gives tons of native integrations through Cordova plugins. 

The main goal of the application was to import geoMaps into the App or use a geolocation map like Google Maps or LeafLet, we decided to use LeafLet to this task because we needed to have full control of the functionalities and customize as we needed the interaction between the geo map and the mobile app.
