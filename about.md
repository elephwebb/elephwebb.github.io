I'm just a ordinary guy born in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil and went away to live in Argentina some time ago, a country that I respect a lot and where my heart lives. 

Autodidact, gamer, web developer, passionated about jazz, folk and gypsy songs.

Crazy for computers since childhood, started play chess at age of 6, solving puzzles and building entire cities and experiencing virtual lives at 10 in SimCity and TheSims. Amazing times!

Had always a passion about Internet and how it truly connects and disconect people and information around the world. 

Love to find out great designed applications around the web, with the perfect balance between effects, user interaction, well distributed data, fast and well written.

Seems easy but actually there is a lot of hard work behind all that, lots of try outs and failures and, as strange as it sounds, but the most "simple things" are the most difficult to accomplish. I think someone already said that, not sure...

All the best! Cheers! :-)
