 I'm a **fullstack web and mobile developer** with 5 years of experience.

 My toolbelt is composed by the following [tools & skills]({{ site.baseurl}}{% link hire-me.md %}).
 
 These are the **[main projects]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link projects.md %})** I've worked so far. Hopefully, the next ones will be yours :-).

 Do you need a hand in developing a new project or make a small fix in your App? 

 Please [send me a message](mailto:{{ site.email }}), I will get back to you within 24 hours with a estimated deadline and price for the job, my minimum price is 15 U$D / hour, but depending on the size and amount of tasks we can negotiate a fixed price for the whole project that best fit your budget.
