Just a ordinary guy born in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil and went away to live in Argentina, a country that I respect a lot and where my heart lives. 

Autodidact, gamer, web developer, passionated about jazz, folk and gypsy songs.

Crazy for games since childhood, started play chess at age of 6, solving puzzles and building entire cities and virtual lives at 10 in SimCity and TheSims.

Had always a passion about Internet, but had never been the most popular guy at school which gave me a lot time to explore social networks, websites and systems at a different perspective. 

Love to find out great designed applications around the web, with the perfect balance between effects, user interaction, well distributed data, fast and well written.

Seems easy but actually there is a lot of hard work behind all that, lots of try outs and failures and, as strange as it sounds, but the most "simple things" are the most difficult to accomplish. I think someone already said that, not sure...

Wanna become a web developer? Try out [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) or send me a message via [via Twitter](https://twitter.com/mrelephwebb).

All the best! Cheers! :-)
