## Introduction ##

This is a full-stack javascript CRM, it will include a node.js API eventually but for now I will be focusing on the frontend and use test-driven $httpBackend to Mock the endpoints.

Why AngularJS and not Angular2-4 or React or another "modern" framework?

Just because AngularJS is still a great tool to build enhanced applications which do not require the complexity that thouse other frameworks bring, but still can be "Modern" if we apply javascript good practices, ES6, tools like Browser-Sync and use tests to orient our development. Plus, many web applications out there still use AngularJS and doesn't have the intention to change so far.


Lots of the features of our development were extracted from hours of learning and some code hacking, checkout all the [resources below](#resources).


## Setting the environment ##

Starting coding on top of a solid codebase, that uses [best practices](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/blob/master/a1/README.md) from [Jonh Pappa](https://johnpapa.net/angular-style-guide/)

git clone the following repo:

## Define requirements ##

What our CRM will have and what not...



## Continous Delivery ##
